# This documentation page is for naming convention, best practices.

## Files naming
- File names are separated with hyphens.
> Ex: student-list
- All file names are lowercase.
- All file names are singular.
> Ex: students-list ❌  
> Ex: student-list ✅

## CSS
- The `BEM` model is used for CSS code. `BEM` stands for `Block Element and Modifier`.  
> Ex: A page with two cards, nav-bar, fields, and buttons.  
> card, textbox, nav-bar, and buttons are `Blocks`.  
> texts, titles, images in cards are `Elements`.  
> Changing button size, changing textbox background color, and ... are `Modifiers` or modification of the code.  
> block--element__modifier --> card--image--resized or card--title.  
- All names are lowercase  
- The CSS classes should be in order with HTML code snippets.
